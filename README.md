# AndroidLabs2

i know that due to how late i am turning in this assignmenet; that i had to just hand it in
there is a bug however; all seems well except i can't seem to get my app to run in the emulator
i'm going to fix this, however; i do understand that since i ran out of time i should just hand it in 

i'll fix it and ifd you could tell me where i went wrong that would be great. I'll also have the next lab in tomorrow, along with the one after that.

I had to do a lot of catching up and learning for all my courses and this lab made me spend a lot of time reviewing my notes

I'll get back on track asap and any questions i have i'll send your way tomorrow!
I'm writing this as of june 7
